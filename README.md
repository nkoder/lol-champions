# LoL Champions (lol-champions)

Website with League of Legends champions created in order to learn ReactJS basics.

## Development

This project has no build tooling because everything required for
 proper work is embedded (eg. transpilation of JSX files).
 Therefore NodeJS is **not required**.
 
However if you want to run development commands listed below,
 you have to install NodeJS on your environment.

* `npm install` - install dependencies required by other `npm` commands
* `npm start` - run the site on local server **with live-reload** (site
   will be available at [http://localhost:3000/]( http://localhost:3000/ ))
   
In case of any problems please note that application was developed with use of:

* node 6.3.1
* npm 3.10.5
* git 2.9.2
* IntelliJ IDEA 2016.2.1
* OS X El Capitan 10.11.6
